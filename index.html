        An interactive installation questioning our interpretation of exotic

      First contact with alien civilizations, conversation with artificial
      intelligences, abstract art analysisâ€”these are all forms of esoteric
      communication with an entity supposedly conscious that interacts with
      intent. But what if the impression of consciousness and intent doesn&#39;t
      emerge from the entity we&#39;re communicating with, but rather from
      within ourselves?

      On August 6, 1967, Irish astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell picked up a
      strange radio signal from outer space: 0.04 second pulses emitted at
      regular intervals of 1.3373 seconds. At this point in the history of
      astrophysics there was no explanation for such a phenomenon, and even some
      scientists believed this to be proof of intelligent extraterrestrial life,
      mandating that the discovery be kept secret so as not to trigger mass
      hysteria. The code name for the signal was LGM-1, standing for
      &quot;little green men 1&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The signals were actually caused by an undiscovered family of rapidly
      rotating neutron stars called pulsars, and the graph that Jocelyn Bell
      Burnell plotted amusingly made its way into the cover art of Unknown
      Pleasures by Joy Division.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is interesting about this story is the short moment between the
      discovery of the radio signals and their explanation, where most of
      humanity unconditionally projected ideas of intelligence, sentience, and
      consciousness onto them. This is actually pretty common in science; there
      is a never-ending list of people seeing either aliens or God&#39;s hand in
      active areas of research like dark matter, string theory, or quantum
      physics.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems as if there is something inside of us that can&#39;t bear the
      idea that when an entity communicates with us in a way that is complex yet
      indecipherable, there is no consciousness behind it. That is based on this
      observation that <em>First Contact</em> makes sense.

      <em>First Contact</em> is an installation where a stream of abstract
      visuals appears on a screen in front of the spectator, whose picture and
      voice are being recorded and processed by an artificial intelligence that
      detects face expression and hand positions. These physical inputs are
      being fed into a program that analyzes them and makes the video evolve in
      real time, thereby creating some kind of exotic conversation between the
      spectator and the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when the spectator is first seen by the machine, its visuals
      would &quot;awaken&quot;, going from slowly evolving dream-like sequences
      to loops with a faster pace, then slowing down again when the spectator
      leaves, clearly proving that the machine has <em>perception</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some interactions are less direct. If the spectator clenches their fist,
      the visual stream starts expressing angriness, with heavy use of harsh
      textures, but not when certain words are being spoken, as if the machine
      not only perceives your physical behavior but is more profoundly aware of
      you, it is cognizant of the information it has.
    </p>
    <p>
      The behavior of the program is not being disclosed to the spectator and is
      near impossible to reverse-engineer, as it is not the goal of the
      installation to be fully <em>understood</em>, rather to be <em>felt</em>.
      It should be derived from the emotions rather than the intellect that the
      spectator should feel the machine think. In other words, the goal for the
      spectator is not to decipher the language of the machine, but rather to
      feel the existence of a language being spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this regard, <em>First Contact</em> is much closer to an abstract work
      of art than systems that attempt to give the illusion of consciousness by
      being indiscernible from human beings: AI chatbots like ChatGPT in real
      life, or golem-related sci-fi creatures like Ava in Ex Machina.
    </p>
    <p>
      These <em>imitative AIs</em> are pretty hard to engineer, for the simple
      reason that the human brain is the most complex structure in the uiverse
      and it&#39;s extremely good at many things; coincidentally being uncanny
      valley&#39;d by imperfect imitations is one of them, so
      <em>First Contact</em> doesn&#39;t take this road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The installation is actually much closer to esoteric movies by directors
      like Lynch who famously refuses to give explanations to his stories,
      letting the viewer make his own interpretations, because only then would
      the story make sense - only with characters created by the viewer
      themselves, in other words only with life projected by the viewer onto the
      work of art, and unintuitively not the other way around.
