## About

Complexity of AI typically goes hand in hand with hierarchy of consciousness:

1. Perception
2. Awareness
3. Sentience
4. Consciousness

and is also positively correlated with the system's size and correctness.

## Definitions

**Perception**: organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the presented information or environment.

**Awareness**: knowing, perceiving and being cognizant of events. In other words, a state where information can be used to impact behavior.

**Sentience**: capacity of a being to experience feelings and sensations

**Consciousness**: sentience and awareness of internal and external existence

**Qualia (singular: quale)**: individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The _what it is like_ character of mental state: the way it feels to experience pain, smelling a rose, or seeing red. The "redness" of red is an example of quale. In the words of Daniel Dennett: _an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: the ways things seem to us_.

**Sapience**: ?

## Perception

Saks and John's model of perception:

- **The perceiver**: person whose awareness is focused on the stimulus. Influenced by:
  - motivational state
  - emotional state
  - experience
- **The target**: something or someone being perceived
- **The situation**: environmental factors, timing, and degree of stimulation

## Mind-body problem

- dualism aka cartesian duality: matter - mind
- monism:
  - physicalism: matter > mind: the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way
  - idealism: matter < mind: only thought truly exists and matter is merely a representation of mental processes
  - neutral monism: matter - matter/mind - mind: both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them
