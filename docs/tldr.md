You talk to the machine in face and hand gestures, the machine responds in abstract visuals. You can't fully understand the logic driving the system made out of a CRT screen, a computer and a webcam; but you can undeniably feel the existence of some esoteric form of communication happening. The machine can remember long gesture sequences and form equally complex combinations of colors, shapes, and textures. So, just like someone receiving unexplained radio signals coming from the depths of outer space, you feel like making the first contact with something intelligent. Something sentient.
